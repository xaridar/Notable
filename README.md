# Notable
A social Android app for location-dependent interaction.

While it is unfortunately still buggy, Notable is a new kind of social interaction app.

### First of all, in Notable, there are no images, or any kind of content besides text. Users can share their thoughts in short sentences of excitement and emotion to connect with one another.

### Notes, as the app's posts are called, are also permanent - a Note will stay in its location forever, available to be found by everyone who passes by it.

### Of course, Notable is most unique for its signature feature - all content on the app is based solely on a user's location.
Notable has completely gotten rid of the idea of followers or likes - instead, the only content a user will see is the content made near them.

This way, local users can create connections by meeting others in Notable, and learn more of ther toughts that the local area has to offer.
And Notable is especially unique when traveling - it provides a new way to explore different location and locate all of its popular spots.

Notable was built in Android Studio using Java and XML, with serveral Firebase products acting as its backend, including authentication, database management, and file storage.
